Red Wine Quality Prediction
This project aims to predict the quality of red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset consists of physicochemical (input) and sensory (output) variables, with no information about grape types, wine brand, or selling price due to privacy and logistic constraints.

The dataset can be approached as either a classification or regression task. The quality scores are ordered and not evenly distributed, meaning there are significantly more normal wines than excellent or poor ones.

Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and is also available for convenience on Kaggle. However, if there are any licensing concerns, the dataset will be promptly removed upon request. Additional details can be found in the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].

Input Variables (Physicochemical Tests)
Fixed acidity
Volatile acidity
Citric acid
Residual sugar
Chlorides
Free sulfur dioxide
Total sulfur dioxide
Density
pH
Sulphates
Alcohol
Output Variable (Sensory Data)
Quality (score between 0 and 10) For further insights and analysis, refer to the research paper by Cortez et al. (2009). This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate the quality of red wines based on their physicochemical properties and sensory attributes.
